            <h2>Jen Myers</h2>
            <h5>Business Development</h5>

            <p> started full-time with Crystal Travel and Tours in 1997 but I had worked part-time during summers before that since it was a family business. I also worked part-time with Icelandair at Logan Airport. After 17 years, I enjoy what I do. As one of the world’s largest and oldest industries, traveling and tourism tends to have a positive impact on those it touches. It is great to be part of such an industry. </p>

            <p>Growing up, my siblings and I spent several weeks each summer visiting family in Ireland. The Cliffs of Moher is a spectacular natural attraction, towering over the Atlantic Ocean. In Britain, the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon, Wales was an experience. Going down into the mine was an education into how some men (and their horses) made a living not too long ago. I visited Cape Town, South Africa about ten years ago with my brother and we really enjoyed the visit.</p>

            <h5>About Jen</h5>

            <p>I visit Ireland quite often and also spent a year studying in Galway. Galway City is great mix of old and new, and a place where the Irish language and traditional music have a very strong presence. It’s a unique place as the heart of the West of Ireland, and one that I always recommend that people visit when in Ireland. I also love Seville in Spain, an immensely historic city - the city’s architecture is quite impressive to view, and there is a great buzz and vibrancy to the city.</p>
